# sm2_encrypt-_and_decrypt
    An implementation of computing SM2 encryption and decryption is provided. Header files and library files of OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher version is needed while compiling and linking. OpenSSL website is: https://www.openssl.org

    SM2 is a cryptographic algorithm based on elliptic curves. It is defined in the following standards of China:

    GB/T32918.1-2016,

    GB/T32918.2-2016,

    GB/T32918.3-2016,

    GB/T32918.4-2016,

    GM/T 0003-2012.

    Computing SM2 encryption and decryption are supported in OpenSSL 1.1.1. In the source package, "/crypto/sm2/sm2_crypt.c" is a good example.
